main.py and AggiE_Database.py are just for generating the database for this tutorial. You don’t need to open them for the tutorial, although you can if you’re more interested in database programming. They were written based on the documentation at http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/tutorial.html 

Otherwise, the jupyter notebook should be self sufficient.
